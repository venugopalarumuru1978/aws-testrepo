What is the importance of Testing in Application Development?

1.  Development
2.  Testing
3.  Deployment
------------------
Testing is classified into two types

1.  Manual Testing
	this type of testing will be done by manually with test engineer. 
	for this test engg. no need to have any programming knowledge.
2.  Automation Testing

2. Add following Dependency in POM.xml for Cucumber
  <dependencies>
	  <!-- https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/io.cucumber/cucumber-java -->
	<dependency>
		<groupId>io.cucumber</groupId>
		<artifactId>cucumber-java</artifactId>
		<version>7.21.1</version>
	</dependency>
</dependencies>

3. Add Feature File
4. Define Senario

Today's Agenda:-
----------------
1.  Creating Tomcat Apache Server
2.  Deploying Web Application in Tomcat Server
3.  Creating Server for MySQL
4.  Connecting to MySQL
5.  S3 Bucket
----------------------
Steps to create tomcat web server:-

1. Create one EC2 Instance
2. Connect to that instance with ssh client
3. Goto browser, then open tomcat server url, then copy the url of the tomcat server with version
https://dlcdn.apache.org/tomcat/tomcat-9/v9.0.107/bin/apache-tomcat-9.0.107.tar.gz
4. Come back to SSH Client machine(command prompt), then download that file with following command
	wget :- this command is used to download any file
	wget  <tomcatURL>
5. Once it is downloaded, unzip it with following command, here unzip means installing
		tar  xvzf  <Tomcat Folder Name>
6. Here to work with tomcat server, system should have "java". if java not exist, server won't starts
	use following command to install java
		sudo yum install java -y   // latest version of Java will be installed.
7. Now to test server, we need to start, use following commands
		cd  apache...Foldername
		cd bin
		sh startup.sh
	to stop server
		sh shutdown.sh
8.  Goto context.xml file from the META-INF folder
		cd  apache...Foldername
		cd  webapps/manager/META-INF
		sudo  vi  context.xml

		now modify "allow" option as follows
			<allow=".*" />
		then save and quit
9.  Provide user details, goto "conf" folder, then modify  tomcat-users.xml file
			cd apach...Foldername
			cd conf
			sudo  vi tomcat-users.xml

	now add following code at the end of the file

	<role rolename="manager-gui"/>
 	<role rolename="manager-script"/>
 	<role rolename="manager-jmx"/>
 	<role rolename="manager-status"/>
 	<user username="admin" password="admin" roles="manager-gui, manager-script, manager-jmx, 		manager-status"/>
 	<user username="deployer" password="deployer" roles="manager-script"/>
 	<user username="tomcat" password="s3cret" roles="manager-gui"/>
		
	Now save and quit

Note :-  If we do any changes in server, the server need to stop and start

10.  Now goto browser, then refresh then click on any link, it will ask  user details 
		provide username/password "admin" and "admin"
	it will open tomcat server dash board
 	
Note :-  if we want to change port no
		cd  apache...Foldername
		cd conf
		sudo  vi server.xml
		
		chnage port number in following tag
		<Connector  port="8090" .... />
----------------------
As per java there are 3 types of output files exist

1. jar files
2. ear files
3. war files  :-  This is output file of web application.

Deploying Web Application into Tomcat Server

1.  Open Eclipse then create one web application
2. Code it as per the requirement, then create 'war' file as follows
	rightClick on Project - Export- war file - specify the location
3.  Open Tomcat  using AWS instance and goto dashboard
	War file to deploy Section
		Click on "Choose File" Button - browse file - then click Deploy button
4. If it is deployed successfully, it visible on dashboard section
--------------------------------
if the application is Maven Application, then to create war file, 
	Right Click on App -> Run As -> Maven Build

this process will create a war file.

How to install  mysql in the server:-
--------------------------------
Create one EC2 Instance using AWS(Take Ubuntu Images)
Step 1: Update the system
sudo apt update

Step 2: Install MySql
sudo apt install mysql-server

Step 3: Check the Status of MySql (Active or Inactive)
sudo systemctl status mysql

Step 4: Login to MySql as a root
sudo mysql

Step 5: Update the password for the MySql Server
ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY 'place-your-password-here';

FLUSH PRIVILEGES;

ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY 'venu1234';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
Step 6: Test the MySql server if it is working by running sample sql queries
CREATE DATABASE mysql_test;

USE mysql_test;

CREATE TABLE table1 (id INT, name VARCHAR(45));

INSERT INTO table1 VALUES(1, 'Virat'), (2, 'Sachin'), (3, 'Dhoni'), (4, 'ABD');

SELECT * FROM table1;
Step 7 : Connect to mysql with user details

mysql -u root -p
---------
To Connect MySQL to MySQL Workbench of Local system.

a.  Define 3306 port no, in In-Bound Rules of Security Group of EC2 Instance
------------------
Linux different flavors are exist
1.  Red Hat
2.  Ubuntu
3.  Amazon Linux
4.  Suse Linux
